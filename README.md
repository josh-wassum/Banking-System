# Overview

The idea behind the software is that a user would be able to create an account, log into their account. Make 
changes to their account, and even close their account. This data will be saved between sessions using a MYSQL Database
allowing a user to exit the system and come back later. The GUI that is available on this project makes use
of the Swing library in Java.

My purpose in designing this software was to gain more experience with programming in Java and using its
various libraries. It also demonstrates my ability to connect a Java program to a widely used Database system.
