# Overview

The idea behind the software is that a user would be able to create an account, log into their account. Make 
changes to their account, and even close their account. This data will be saved between sessions using an XML file
allowing a user to exit the system and come back later. The GUI that is available on this project makes use
of the Swing library in Java.

My purpose in designing this software was to gain more experience with programming in Java and using its
various libraries. This program is to demonstrate my skill in creating a Java program from scratch that
uses various concepts of Object Orientated Programming.

# Future Work

* Currently, the application only quits when selecting exit, need to add functionality that quits the system when the user selects the X in the GUI.
* Need to validate data before converting it to doubles on the AccountView deposit, and withdraw inputs.
* I am going to connect the application to a SQL Database using [SQLLite](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_java.htm#:~:text=SQLite%20-%20Java%201%20Installation.%20Before%20you%20start,6%20UPDATE%20Operation.%20...%207%20DELETE%20Operation.%20).
